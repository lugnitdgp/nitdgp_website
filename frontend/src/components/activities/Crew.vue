        <h2 style="color: #FFF;width: 100%;">Introduction</h2>
          <p style="padding: 10px;">
            It is well-known that environmental pollution is a threat to humankind, especially in terms of human health and to ecological systems. Special mention may be made of many industries in and around Durgapur city, such as Durgapur Steel Plant, Durgapur Chemicals Limited, The Durgapur Projects limited, Philips Carbon Black, Alloy Steels Plant, Eastern Coalfields Limited, etc. and also many small scale industries. Extensive agricultural activity is also prevalent in Barddhaman district. As Durgapur is a rapidly developing city with a burgeoning population, increasing use of fossil fuels and generation of municipal wastes are associated with its development. In this localized scenario as well as in the national scenario, a state of the art centre for studies and research on such environmental issues is extremely relevant. A centre with a multidisciplinary approach towards advanced research on environment and water in an institute of national importance, such as National Institute of Technology Durgapur can play a very effective role in this regard. Such a centre would need precision high value analytical instruments for this activity. The centre would aim to develop the expertise to assist industry and civic administrations in developing and implementing evaluation, remediation or management strategies for contamination issues and develop technologies to convert wastes to value-added products wherever feasible. Hybrid treatment technologies encompassing chemical, biological and physico-chemical treatment schemes would be a viable and practical option to substitute inadequate conventional treatment systems. As the Centre is interdisciplinary in nature and made by multiple departments like Department of Earth and Environmental Studies, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Management Studies and Computer Science & Engineering to implement for ensuring total environmental compliance by industrial houses and municipal bodies.
