            The Student affiliated chapter of The Indian Institute of Metals was passed through council Meeting No: 342/III/2019-20 on Saturday,22nd November 2020 held at Kaladham Conference Hall, Vidyanagar in presence of president, Dr. U Kamachi Mudali [2019-20 Council Year] and other council members as per Point 6b resolution.
            On the 19th of September, 2020 NIT Durgapur, paced its first steps towards inducting the students’ chapter of Indian Institute of Metals into its working structure. The inaugural program, organized by the Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department of NIT Durgapur, was long-sought and despite seeing some delays, the event was attended with much zeal and enthusiasm by all. Keeping in with the COVID-19 restrictions, the program was held entirely online via the Microsoft Teams platform and was also live-streamed on Facebook and YouTube simultaneously. The event saw over 250 registrations and was attended by a vast diaspora of proficient personalities of the Academic World that included eminent professors, research scholars, graduate and undergraduate students.
            Dr M.M. Ghosh, HoD of the Metallurgical and Materials (MME) Department commenced the inauguration by welcoming the guests. He lauded the efforts put in by everyone within the department and in the college to make this students’ chapter a success. He illuminated the department’s rich academic heritage and extended his support, willingness and devotion towards working in co-operation with the students’ chapter in organizing seminars and events throughout the year for the benefit of the students. He also encouraged more students to become a part of this organization and reap the benefits of being a member to the fullest.  Mr. L. Badu, the Secretary, IIM – Local Chapter, Durgapur, commended the efforts put in by the faculty in-charges, and the interest shown by NIT, the college itself, towards the formation of this students’ branch. He emphasized on the harmonious and smooth working of IIM in association with NIT Durgapur and especially the MME Department, in a way that will be of advantage to all, in academics to research and eventually nation building. Prof. Biswajit Halder, Dean of Student Welfare, NIT Durgapur, recalled the glitches of paperwork that came in the way and despite all the difficulties and delays, he admired the unbreakable dedication and efforts put in by the HoD and the Faculty In-charge to help the students chapter take shape into reality. He wished luck and provided subtle guidance to the students associated with the chapter for the easy functioning of the branch within the college. The Director of NIT Durgapur, Prof. Anupam Basu welcomed and appreciated every one. Despite being a professor in Computer Science Engineering himself, he stated that he was familiar with the activities of IIM right from his college days in IIT Kharagpur. He appreciated the department for being proactive in several academic and research assignments and praised its efforts for introducing the students’ branch of IIM. He put forth a very thought-provoking suggestion for the newly inducted student members of IIM-Student’s Chapter, that is to interact with school students and encourage them to take up this field of study and acquaint them with the challenges ahead, in an effort that they may choose this as a career option out of passion. 
            The Guest of Honor for the event, Prof. K. Chattopadhyay, who also happens to an eminent alumnus of NIT Durgapur and an ex-president of IIM, then addressed the event. He recalled that during his college days, the concept of a student chapter had not been given much attention. He detailed the benefits that students may gain from the organization, working together and learning from it. He laid importance on the fact of how powerful a tool virtual meetings could be. He suggested a joint venture wherein all the students’ chapters all across the country could organize virtual seminars and conferences. He also spoke briefly about an upcoming educational portal, which will launch soon and will assist students in learning and gathering more information about the subjects through its resources. His words of encouragement and inspiration were received well by everyone.
            Prof. A. Gokhale, the President of IIM and also the Chief Guest for the inaugural ceremony, stressed on different shortcomings of technical education and suggested ways to overcome them. As a nation with the highest number of Engineering graduates each year and a rich, resourceful reinforcement, he weighed upon the need for an inclusive effort from the Metallurgical, Mechanical and Chemical Engineers’ Society to work together for improving the current standards. He reminded all about our duty towards the environment at the same time. Speaking to the students, he said, IIM will provide the source of in-depth knowledge for the students and will also guide them in modeling a better perspective in their professional careers as over time, the students will get to interact with people in the Industries, Research and Development, and the people directly involved in Policy Making. The overwhelming exposure will come as a magnificent boon to the undergraduate students in the time to come. He also spoke at length about the future endeavors scheduled at IIM, the monthly magazine – IIM Metal News and the Platinum Jubilee of IIM. He appreciated the faculty in-charge and HoD for fulfilling all the requirements for opening a student chapter within a short time frame.
            Dr. Arup Kumar Mandal, the Faculty in-charge of IIM Student Chapter- NIT Durgapur, on behalf of the Organizing Committee, presented the vote of thanks and expressed his warm regards and gratitude towards the Chief Guest, the Guest of Honor, other distinguished guests and all the attendees of the online event.
